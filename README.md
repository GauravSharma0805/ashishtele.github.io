## Ashish Tele

I am Ashish. I am a full-time graduate student at the University of Connecticut, pursuing the degree in the Business Analytics and Project Management. My interest in applied analytics and data science led to creating the blog post in 2015 and now the posts are pilling up!

My area of focus and expertise lie in portraying the business insights in a striking way. I started with the reports, moved to the dashboards and now focusing on the infographics. I firmly believe in a statement that says ‘If an information is not conveyed to a recipient, it is not the information!‘.
