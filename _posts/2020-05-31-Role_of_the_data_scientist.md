Hi All,

I came across the article "The Role of the Data Scientist" by Carl and Sean. They have raised a few burning questions about the data scientist role such as:

1. Will automation replace the data scientist role?
2. Does 'intuition' still play a pivotal role in the industry or the data-driven approach is well received?
3. Has the data scientist role plateaued?
