Hi All, 
I am writing this blog post to share my experience of an earthquake! We were travelling from San Diego to Las Vegas through the Death Valley.
We started our journey early morning to reach at Vegas on time. We were enjoyinh the scenic view and capturing the moments. It was a hot day (105F).
We decided to stop to click few pictures and fortunately, the time was perfect(scary though!) to experience my first earthquake.

I was capturing moments thorugh my iphone. You can determine the location where you clicked the picture. To extract the metadata, I used 
ExifWizard mobile application. It gives most of the information we require.
