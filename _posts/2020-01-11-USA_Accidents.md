Hi All,

Happy New Year!!

Recently I came across a dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) about USA traffic accidents (2016 - 19). As per the [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents), "This is a countrywide traffic accident dataset, which covers 49 states of the United States. The data is collected from February 2016 to March 2019, using several data providers, including two APIs which provide streaming traffic event data. These APIs broadcast traffic events captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 2.25 million accident records in this dataset."

I found this dataset very interesting because of the data size and efforts authors put to gather the data. A huge shout out to them!
