Hi All,

Recently I came across a scenario where we had to feed the data to the multi-regression model. 
The data had multiple granular levels to aggregate and run the model. The scenario is around 
the level of granularity and what happens if the data granularity identifier column is not 
included in the model. I am using a toy dataset to do this analysis.
