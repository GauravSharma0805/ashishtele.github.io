Hi All,

This is my first post on Github page. Please find old posts at [blog](https://ashishtele1992.wordpress.com/).

There are many things changing in the industry and especially related to data manipulation and visualization. There are few new entries such as [Google Data Studio](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/data-studio/), Microsoft SandDance, and [Popily](http://developers.popily.com/). This rapid change in the visualization industry is because of the fact that the people want to visualize the data.

Recently I got a chance to read two magnificent books by [Edward Tufte](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) and [Scott Berinato](https://hbr.org/product/good-charts-the-hbr-guide-to-making-smarter-more-persuasive-data-visualizations/15005-PBK-ENG). These books give you a new way of thinking and designing. There are many apt statements in the book ‘Good Charts by Scott Berinato’ which make you think twice before designing the reports. I think I shall go through these books again as with each read, you enrich your ideas and thoughts that also visually!

The way of storytelling has changed and it is evolving. We had reports and dashboards to present the information, but they are changing and that is also for the good. Now we have a server hosted information and the web-based interactive reporting tools. Instead of sending 15 MB excel report in the mail, analysts are sending encrypted report URL. Companies are adopting the change as it is competitive.

I tried something new this time with my resume. So instead of having it in pdf/word document, I made an interactive report out of it. I used Power BI, my favorite, to create it. The challenge is to create the backend data as we need to take care of each possible combination so that the view won’t change. It took some time but the result is captivating. Company names and skills are interactive. We can see the company based skills and expertise. Have a look!

I designed the layout on paper and changed it a lot of times before finalizing. I then created backend data for the report and tried all the possible combinations. I designed my first version and sent it to [Miguel Myers](https://twitter.com/myersmiguel). He suggested few points which were missing in the first version and explained the points as a Graphic Designer(best). I recreated the view and this is a new version.
