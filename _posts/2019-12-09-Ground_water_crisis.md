Hi All,

I have been a big fan of open government data sources such as [data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/) 
and [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/). Recently I came across a data source called [Dynamic Ground Water Resources](https://data.gov.in/resources/district-wise-dynamic-ground-water-resources-march-2013). It has rich information 
about groundwater recharge (rainfall) and discharge (draft), The data column definitions were new to me so I have added
them for reference purposes.

**Groundwater draft**: It is the quantity of **groundwater** withdrawn artificially or naturally from the aquifers in a study area, during certain period. The out flow from the system is considered mainly through the **groundwater draft**. [Ref](https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/70835/14/14_chapter%205%20groundwater.pdf)

**HaM (hectare-meter)**:A volume of 10 000 cubic meters created by flooding an area of one hectare to a depth of one meter, thus creating a volume one hectare by one meter. [Ref](http://www.kylesconverter.com/volume/hectare-meters-to-cubic-meters)

It contains the information of **662** Indian districts. The overall data quality is good. It does not have many **NA** values.
