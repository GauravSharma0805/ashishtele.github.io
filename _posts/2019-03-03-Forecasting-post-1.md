1. Introduction

I got an opportunity to work on a demand forecasting project 
which involved secondary research and talking to subject matter experts.
I used SAS Enterprise Guide, SAS Forecasting Studio, and R for end to end solution 
development. 

I used SAS EG to for data manipulation and SAS FS to create (bottom-up) forecasts.
The similar process was followed in R (R Studio IDE) where I leveraged different 
packages to implement the algorithms.

See you in next post.
