In 2015, I received a case study with an open problem asking to find an answer, that is all. It had an excel with a big sparse matrix. It was an image processing problem. I submitted a naive answer but the fastest to reach. I solved it in Excel with conditional formatting ðŸ˜‚. I think they were not expecting this approach but I came across a baseline solution with minimal resources. When I put conditional formatting on the matrix and zoom out the Excel to 10%, I arrived the answer ðŸ’ª. Not all solutions need advanced approaches, common sense is important. 

When I was going through my archive, I found this picture. My old picture but in deformed condition. I tried many online portals to bring it back to original, but most of them can't restore it to the original. So, finally, get your hands dirty!
