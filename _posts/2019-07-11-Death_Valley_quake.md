Hi All, 

I am writing this blog post to share my experience of an earthquake! We were traveling from San Diego to Las Vegas through the Death Valley. We started our journey early morning to reach Vegas on time. We were enjoying the scenic view and capturing the moments. It was a hot day (105F). We decided to stop to click few pictures and fortunately, the time was perfect (scary thought!) to experience my first earthquake.

I was capturing moments through my iPhone. You can determine the location where you clicked the picture. To extract the metadata, I used the ExifWizard mobile application. It gives most of the information we require.

The below image gives the timestamp and coordinates of the location:

Now. Let's see the timing of the earthquake and its epicenter:

We can calculate the distance based on the latitude and longitude coordinates. I used Google map distance finder to calculate the 
distance between the points.

And we were this much away from the epicenter!

So, **25KM**, that's it!!

[Volcanodiscovery](https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/2019/07/04/17h33/magnitude6-CA-USA-quake.html) provides the Distance vs 
Intensity graph to check the intensity (mmi) we felt.

As per the graph, we felt maximum intensity of 6.8 mmi (median) at our location which was 25 KM away.

Crazy experience!!!

We had another surprise on July 5th (2019) as well! ðŸ™‚
