I was researching about using human mobility data for retail data science work. Carto(https://carto.com/) works in specially focused retail analytics. They use human mobility data to answer:
Reduce traffic congestion
Insights on commuting patterns
Incident responses

I am writing this blog when COVID-19 is at its peak in Itlay and Spain. As per the research, the USA and India are 8-10 days behind the curve observed in Itlay and Spain if the required precautions are overlooked. 

I was reading a couple of articles from India where the person who was asked to self-quarantine, disobeyed the rule and traveled through public transportation. The person endangered the lives of many people including oneself. It becomes difficult to retrace the route a person used before getting identified. Also, it is an arduous job for the officials to understand and estimate how many people did come in contact with the probably infected person.
