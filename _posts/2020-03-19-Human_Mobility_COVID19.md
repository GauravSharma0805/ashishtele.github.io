Hi All,

I was researching about using human mobility data for retail data science work. [Carto](https://carto.com/) works in spatially focused retail analytics. They use human mobility data to answer:

1. Reduce traffic congestion
2. Insights on commuting patterns
3. Incident responses

I am writing this blog when **COVID-19** is at its peak in **Itlay** and **Spain**. As per the research, the **USA** and **India** are 8-10 days behind the curve observed in Itlay and Spain if the required precautions are overlooked. 

I was reading a couple of articles from India where the person who was asked to self-quarantine, disobeyed the rule and traveled through public transportation. The person endangered the lives of many people including oneself. It becomes difficult to retrace the route a person used before getting identified. Also, it is an arduous job for the officials to understand and estimate how many people did come in contact with the probably infected person. 

**Can we not use anonymized human mobility data to check probable spread?**

I came across an article by [Google AI](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/11/new-insights-into-human-mobility-with.html) which mentions how human mobility data can be used for predicting epidemics. Data is completely anonymized and hence the user information is secured.
